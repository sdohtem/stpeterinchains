      The Cathedral Altar Servers Team (CAST) was started in January 2015 as a
      means to unite young people and families around the beautiful ministry of
      serving at the altar.

      Students from Grade 3 onward are invited to join. The CAST meets
      regularly for training sessions followed by fun social time.

      In 2016, the growing number of members encouraged CAST to be divided
      into two age groups, Seniors and Juniors. All CAST members are prepared
      in the art of serving the altar for masses and other liturgical
      celebrations.

      We are always happy to welcome new CAST members, so please join!
      If you would like more information or if you would like to join, please
      see below for contact information.

      The minister of hospitality (or greeter) is a relatively new role for
      Catholics. As part of our efforts to build up the community of
      Saint&nbsp;Peter&#x2011;in&#x2011;Chains, under the direction of our
      pastor, the Cathedral will soon be asking our ushers to expand their
      role to include a hospitality ministry.

      If you are interested in being a part of this ministry, please call the
      Cathedral Office to speak to Kathy for details.

      ordinary ministers of Holy Communion are unavailable.
