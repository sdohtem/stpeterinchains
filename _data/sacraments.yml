  The Holy Sacraments of the Catholic Church represent the channels
  through which an individual receives the graces each represents.

  receiving the Sacraments of Initiation into the Church. For those considering
  commitment in Matrimony, we provide spiritual instruction in preparation for
  this sacred vocation.

  # Sacramental Preparation for School-Age Children

  His Excellency, Bishop Daniel Miehm, Bishop of Peterborough, has brought the
  parishes of the Diocese together to offer a Sacramental Preparation Program
  that is consistent in form and content. This initiative is designed to assist
  the home, school, and parish in nurturing the faith of your child as you
  prepare them for receiving the Sacraments.
