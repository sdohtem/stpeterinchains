      The iconic Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains is an historic
      Roman Catholic parish
      [located in the heart of Peterborough](https://goo.gl/maps/Vz73TcvLW8P2).
      The Cathedral has stood since 1837, and stands today as a centre of
      Christian ministry and service to the community at large.

      The 180 year history of this remarkable church is emblematic of our
      Christian heritage, bridging yesterday and today.
      Come, see what the contemporary Catholic experience is all
      about, in the beauty of an historic cathedral.

      The Cathedral was constructed in 1837 and is easily one of the most
      iconic and recognizable buildings in Peterborough.
      In addition to the regular operational expenses of a living,
      breathing faith community, funding the ongoing maintenance of an
      historic, 180-year-old building is a major operational challenge for
      our Parish.

      Help ensure that our children will know and enjoy this beautiful
      Cathedral in the years and decades to come.
      Please consider regular donations, or
      [donate&nbsp;online](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/cathedral-of-st-peter-in-chains/).
