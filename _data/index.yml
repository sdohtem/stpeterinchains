      The centre of our Parish is the iconic
      Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains, an historic Roman Catholic church
      [located in the heart of Peterborough](https://goo.gl/maps/Vz73TcvLW8P2).

      This remarkable church, which has stood for over 180 years, is emblematic
      of our Christian heritage, a bridge between yesterday and today.
      Come, see what the contemporary Catholic experience is all about,
      in the beauty of an historic cathedral.

      The Cathedral was constructed in 1837 and is easily one of the most
      iconic and recognizable buildings in the
      [City of Peterborough](http://www.peterborough.ca).
      In addition to the regular operational expenses of a living,
      breathing faith community, funding the ongoing maintenance of an
      historic building is a major operational challenge for our Parish.

      Help ensure that our children will know and enjoy this beautiful
      Cathedral in the years and decades to come.
      Please consider regular donations, or
      [donate&nbsp;online](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/cathedral-of-st-peter-in-chains/).
