But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works....\" says Christ our Lord.\n\nDuring this season of Lent, we hear the amazing miracles, wonders, sayings and teachings of Christ. The purpose of His coming is to give us all life, a life that will never end. He wants us all to be with Him forever.\n\nWhen we put our trust in Christ and do everything according to His will, we will be given life. Yes, we will have prosperity on earth and everlasting life after.\n\nLet us keep the commandments of Christ namely loving God with all our heart, mind, body and soul; and loving our neighbour as ourselves. God bless. - Fr. Peter Selvaraj"},{"title":"Palm Sunday Mass","subtitle":"March 28, 2021","color":"#933","youtube":"YWxNNrTerhY","descriptive":""},{"title":"Chrism Mass","subtitle":"March 29, 2021","color":"#933","youtube":"Zg_GPr_-ciw","descriptive":""}],"regularEvents":[{"title":"Weekend Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Saturday","time":"5:00 PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"7:30 AM, 9:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 12:00 PM"}],"descriptive":"Join us for our signature Mass."},{"title":"Weekday Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"7:30 AM &amp; 12:10 PM"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Confession","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"11:30AM - 12:00PM"},{"day":"Saturday","time":"4:00PM - 5:00PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"Before Masses"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Stations of the Cross","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Friday","time":"Following 12:10PM Mass during Lent"}],"descriptive":""}],"specialEvents":[{"title":"Special Mass","subtitle":"Chrism Mass","color":"#933","location":"YouTube","times":[{"day":"March 29, 2021","time":"2:00PM"}],"descriptive":"\n\nCelebrated at the Cathedral of St. Peter-In-Chains,\nby Most Rev.
