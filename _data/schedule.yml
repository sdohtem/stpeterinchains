      - title: The Liturgy of Tenebrae
        descriptive: |
          *Tenebrae* is Latin for shadows or darkness. Join&nbsp;us for this
          unforgettable service of music, song, chants, and lessons in the
          spirit of the darkness of the&nbsp;Crucifixion, which preceded the
          light of the&nbsp;Resurrection.

          Candles are gradually extinguished during the service.
          As the final candle is extinguished to enshroud the church in
          darkness, the *strepitus* (or great noise) will be heard, symbolizing
          the earthquake that accompanied the death&nbsp;of&nbsp;Christ.
          Parishioners will then rise and leave in&nbsp;silence.

          It is recommended that parishioners arrive early to ensure
          seating for this special&nbsp;event.
