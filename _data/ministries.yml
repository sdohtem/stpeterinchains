      The minister of hospitality (or greeter) is a relatively new role for
      Catholics. As part of our efforts to build up the community of
      Saint&nbsp;Peter&#x2011;in&#x2011;Chains, under the direction of our
      pastor, the Cathedral will soon be asking our ushers to expand their
      role to include a hospitality ministry.

      If you are interested in being a part of this ministry, please call the
      Cathedral Office to speak to Kathy for details.
