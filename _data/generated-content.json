Reflect, today, upon this beautiful virtue of patient endurance. The trials of life should ideally be seen not in a negative way but as an invitation to patient endurance.\n\nContemplate the way you endure your own trials. Is it with deep and ongoing patience, hope and joy? Or is it with anger, bitterness and despair. Pray for the gift of this virtue and seek to imitate this crippled man.\n\nLet us Pray… My Lord of all hope, You endured so much in life and persevered through it all in perfect obedience to the will of the Father.\n\nGive me strength during the trials of life so that I can grow strong in the hope and the joy that comes with that strength. May I turn away from sin and turn to You in complete trust. - Fr. Joshy George"},{"title":"St. Joseph Novena","subtitle":"March 15, 2021 - Day 6","descriptive":"Today is the sixth day of a 9 day Novena.\n\nJoin us in praying the\n[Novena to St. Joseph](https://www.peterboroughdiocese.org/en/life-and-faith/year-of-st--joseph.aspx)."},{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"March 14, 2021","color":"#933","youtube":"xTF7Pwz842g","descriptive":""}],"regularEvents":[{"title":"Weekend Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Saturday","time":"5:00 PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"7:30 AM, 9:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 12:00 PM"}],"descriptive":"Join us for our signature Mass."},{"title":"Weekday Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"7:30 AM &amp; 12:10 PM"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Confession","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"11:30AM - 12:00PM"},{"day":"Saturday","time":"4:00PM - 5:00PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"Before Masses"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Stations of the Cross","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Friday","time":"Following 12:10PM Mass during Lent"}],"descriptive":""}],"specialEvents":[{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"Fourth Sunday in Lent","color":"#933","location":"YouTube","times":[{"day":"March 14, 2021","time":"8:00AM"}],"descriptive":"\n\nCelebrated at the Cathedral of St. Peter-In-Chains,\nby Rev.
