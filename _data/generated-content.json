Reflect, today, upon the beautiful commandment of our Lord.\n\nIt is a command of love, and it is given to us not so much for God’s sake but for ours.

I pray that I will learn to love You with every fiber of my being, holding nothing back, and to daily grow deeper in my love of You.\n\nAs I grow in that love, I thank You for the overflowing nature of that love, and I pray that this love of You will flow into the hearts of those around me. - Fr.
