  Cancellation of Masses&mdash;Preventing the Spread of&nbsp;COVID-19

text: |
  # General Statement

  ## All Masses will be cancelled from Monday March 16 to Sunday April 5

  In solidarity with the efforts of the government and the community to
  mitigate the further spread of COVID-19, the following safety measures
  dealing with the celebration of the Sacraments in the Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains will
  ensure that our practices are in full compliance with the required
  restrictions of the Ontario Ministry of Health in response to the global
  pandemic:

  - Places of worship are not exempt from the recommended restrictions on
  mass gathering. Public health officials continue to recommend that all
  mass gatherings of 50 people or more be cancelled, and this includes
  worship gatherings.

  - Any event that has more than 50 attendees and expects to have international
  participants, or involves critical infrastructure staff, seniors, or other
  high-risk populations, should also cancelled.

  - Events that do not meet these criteria can proceed at this time, but risk
  mitigation must be in place, such as enforcing distancing of one or two
  metres between attendees and using sanitizer stations.


  # Funeral Masses

  Funeral Masses may be celebrated in the Cathedral but attendance is
  restricted to the immediate family. Funeral services without a Mass may be
  held in the funeral homes. Funeral receptions are prohibited.

  **Sprinkling**: When holy water is required for blessing, fill a clean vessel
  with fresh water. Bless the water either before or during the celebration.
  Immediately following the celebration, pour the remaining water down the
  sacrarium. You should not touch the water with your hands but use an
  aspergillum.

  **Sign of Peace**: Refrain from shaking hands. A simple bow, nod, or
  "Peace be with you" to your neighbour is appropriate.

  **Holy Communion**: Only distribute Holy Communion under the Body of
  Christ&nbsp;(Host). Only priests may distribute Holy Communion to those who
  choose to receive on their tongue at a designated area apart from the main
  aisle. Those who choose to receive Holy Communion in the hand will be asked
  to approach the Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion or a priest who is
  not distributing Communion to those receiving o­­n the tongue. Only priests are
  to consume the Precious Blood.

  **Recognizing non-communicants**: Ministers may offer a brief prayer for
  those in the Assembly who come forward in the communion procession and
  who are not receiving Holy Communion, such as "May God bless you" or "May God
  continue the good work in you." This prayer is to be offered audibly and may
  not be accompanied by the gesture associated with a blessing, e.g., the
  raising of the hand or the sign of the cross. Neither ordinary nor
  Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion should touch the individual.

  **Hand Hygiene**: Ministers of communion should sanitize their hands both
  before and after distributing communion.


  # Sacrament of Reconciliation

  The Sacrament may be celebrated in a manner that fulfils the
  requirements mandated by Ontario Ministry of Health:

  - **Confessions from behind a screen**: The required distance needs to be
  maintained between the penitent and confessor and the confessional screens
  should be sanitized after each use. Due to the small space of some
  confessionals, it may be necessary to set up a separate reconciliation room
  to ensure the required distance between the penitent and confessor. The
  screen should still be sanitized after each use unless there is a distance
  kept between the penitent and the screen as well.

  - **Face-to-face confessions**: These are permitted as long as the required
  distance is maintained between the penitent and the confessor.

  - There should be no physical contact between the penitent and the confessor.

  - Public penitential services are prohibited.


  # Anointing of the Sick

  Anointing of the Sick may be celebrated according to the following
  directives:

  - Only immediate family, if present, may gather with the priest and sick
  person.

  - If confession is to be celebrated before the anointing, please maintain the
  required physical distance.

  - Use a cotton ball to apply the oil for the anointing. The cotton ball
  should be burned later.

  - If the person to be anointed is in a health care facility, the priest has
  the obligation to check restrictions in place in the facility.


  # Sacrament Preparation

  All sacrament preparation workshops or sessions are cancelled and are
  prohibited. With parents being the first teachers of the Faith, parents are
  responsible for the formation of their children using the prescribed program
  materials and are to attest to the readiness of the candidates for the
  sacraments.


  # RCIA

  Formation of catechumens and candidates are suspended. It will be left to the
  Pastor to determine their readiness. The celebration of full initiation will
  be postponed to later in the year. The celebration of the sacraments for full
  initiation will be postponed to later in the year as determined by the Bishop
  in consultation with the parish priest.


  # Holy Week

  Prior to the week of April 5, a new directive will be issued to address Holy
  Week and the celebration of the Paschal Triduum.


  # Spiritual Communion

  When we receive the Sacrament of Holy Communion, "we unite ourselves to
  Christ, who makes us sharers in his Body and Blood to form a single
  body" (CCC 1331). Those who are unable to attend Mass or to receive the
  Sacrament are encouraged to unite themselves to Christ in prayer through what
  is known as a spiritual communion. As Pope St. John Paul II explained in his
  encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia (no. 34), when it is not possible to
  receive communion it is beneficial to cultivate in your heart a constant
  desire for the Sacrament. This prayer from St. Alphonsus of Liguori can help
  you to make this act of spiritual communion:

  > My Jesus,

  > I believe that You are present in the Most Holy Sacrament.

  > I love You above all things, and I desire to receive You into my soul.

  > Since I cannot at this moment receive You sacramentally,

  > come at least spiritually into my heart.

  > I embrace You as if You were already there and unite myself wholly to You.

  > Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.

  # Public Gatherings

  Apart from Funeral Masses, there are no other public gatherings permitted
  until further notice.


  # Access to the Cathedral

  The Cathedral will open during the day so that individuals may be able to
  visit and pray before the Blessed Sacrament in the tabernacle. However,
  assembly of groups are not permitted. The number of people present
  inside the Cathedral should be restricted so as to observe the Ontario Ministry of Health
  recommendations for social distancing.
