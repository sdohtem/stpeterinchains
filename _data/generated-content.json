Reflect, today, upon how merciful and generous you are willing to be, especially toward those who do not appear to deserve it.\n\nRemind yourself that life of grace is not about being fair; it is about being generous to a shocking extent. Commit yourself to this depth of generosity toward all and look for ways that you can console another’s heart with the mercy of God.\n\nIf you do, that generous love will also bless your heart in abundance.\n\nLet us Pray… My most generous Lord, You are compassionate beyond what I can fathom. Your mercy and goodness far exceed what any of us deserve.\n\nHelp me to be eternally grateful for Your goodness and help me to offer that same depth of mercy to those in most need.  - Fr. Joshy George"},{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"March 7, 2021","color":"#933","youtube":"EjeiTzCoXMs","descriptive":""}],"regularEvents":[{"title":"Weekend Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Saturday","time":"5:00 PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"7:30 AM, 9:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 12:00 PM"}],"descriptive":"Join us for our signature Mass."},{"title":"Weekday Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"7:30 AM &amp; 12:10 PM"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Confession","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"11:30AM - 12:00PM"},{"day":"Saturday","time":"4:00PM - 5:00PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"Before Masses"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Stations of the Cross","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Friday","time":"Following 12:10PM Mass during Lent"}],"descriptive":""}],"specialEvents":[{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"Third Sunday in Lent","color":"#933","location":"YouTube","times":[{"day":"March 7, 2021","time":"8:00AM"}],"descriptive":"\n\nCelebrated at the Cathedral of St. Peter-In-Chains,\nby Most Rev.
