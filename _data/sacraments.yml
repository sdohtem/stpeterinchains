descriptive: |
  The Holy Sacraments of the Catholic Church represent the channels
  through which an individual receives the graces each represents.
  Our parish offers classes for both children and adults in preparation for
  receiving the Sacraments of Initiation into the Church. For those considering
  commitment in Matrimony, we provide spiritual instruction in preparation for
  this sacred vocation.

  You are invited to complete the respective application forms and to contact
  the Rectory Office.

  # Sacramental Preparation for School-Age Children

  His Excellency, Bishop Daniel Miehm, Bishop of Peterborough, has brought the
  parishes of the Diocese together to offer a Sacramental Preparation Program
  that is consistent in form and content. This initiative is designed to assist
  the home, school, and parish in nurturing the faith of your child as you
  prepare them for receiving the Sacraments.
