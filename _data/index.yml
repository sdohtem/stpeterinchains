        The centre of our Parish is the iconic **Cathedral&nbsp;of
        Saint&nbsp;Peter-in-Chains**, an historic Roman Catholic church
        located in the heart of [Peterborough, Ontario](https://goo.gl/maps/Vz73TcvLW8P2).

        This remarkable church, which has stood for over 180 years, is emblematic
        of our Christian heritage, a bridge between yesterday and today.
        Come, see what the contemporary Catholic experience is all about,
        in the beauty of an historic cathedral.

        Our Parish is blessed to have an
        [extraordinary team of faith leaders](/clergy.html),
        known in the community for their devotion to
        Catholic faith and principles.

        If you are seeking *Christ* in your life,
        have questions about the Catholic faith, or
        are interested in becoming part of a faith community,
        speak to one of our priests.
        They invite your questions, welcome dialogue,
        and are always willing to help!

        Are you seeking *Christ*, curious about the Catholic faith,
        or simply new to the Peterborough area?

        As a Catholic faith community, we're here to spread the gospel of
        *Jesus&nbsp;Christ*.
        We believe there's no better way to live this life than in the moral
        principles of the Christian faith.

        Attend a mass or other faith event. Talk to a priest.
        Meet others in our community. Check out the [Schedule](/schedule.html),

      title: Become a volunteer
      text: |
        Our parish is a vibrant community of Christians, just like you.
        Many contribute their time, energy, and talent to ministry
        through music, hospitality, and many other ways.

        Consider becoming a volunteer. Whether you have a musical talent, would
        enjoy speaking, are gifted in hospitality, have professional knowledge,
        or simply want to give back by assisting during masses and other
        events, there's a place in our Parish where you can help.
        See the [Ministries](/ministries.html) page to learn more.

        The Cathedral was constructed in 1837 and is easily one of the most
        iconic and recognizable buildings in the
        [City of Peterborough](http://www.peterborough.ca).
        In addition to the regular operational expenses of a living,
        breathing faith community, funding the ongoing maintenance of an
        historic building is a major operational challenge for our Parish.

        Help ensure that our children will know and enjoy this beautiful
        Cathedral in the years and decades to come.
        Please consider regular donations, or
        [donate&nbsp;online](/giving.html).
