  The seven Holy Sacraments of the Catholic Church represent the channels
  by which grace is received by the individual who receives them.
  Our parish offers preparatory classes for both children and adults in
  the application of the Sacraments and for initiation in Church.
  Those interested are invited to complete the respective application
  forms and to contact the Rectory office.
