Reflect, today, upon those parts of your life that Jesus wants to cleanse.\n\nAllow Him to speak directly and firmly to you so that you will be driven to repentance.  The Lord loves you with a perfect love and desires that all sin in your life be cleansed.\n\nLet us Pray… Lord, I know that I am a sinner who is in need of Your mercy and, at times, in need of Your holy wrath.  Help me to humbly receive Your rebukes of love and to allow You to drive all sin from my life.\n\nHave mercy on me, dear Lord. Please have mercy. - Fr.
