Too often, the deception of material wealth and worldly possessions dominate our desires.\n\nIn fact, even those who have little can easily become consumed with these unhealthy desires. Seek, instead, to desire only that which is eternal. Desire love of God and love of neighbor.\n\nMake this your only goal in life and you, too, will be carried away by angels when your life is completed.\nLet us Pray…\n\nMy Lord of true riches, You chose to be poor in this world as a sign to us that true riches come not with material wealth but with love. Help me to love You, my God, with all my being and to love others as You love them.\n\nMay I be wise enough to make spiritual riches my single goal in life so that these riches will be enjoyed for all eternity. - Fr. Joshy George"},{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"February 28, 2021","color":"#933","youtube":"ERyGt6zxyWw","descriptive":""}],"regularEvents":[{"title":"Weekend Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Saturday","time":"5:00 PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"7:30 AM, 9:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 12:00 PM"}],"descriptive":"Join us for our signature Mass."},{"title":"Weekday Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"7:30 AM &amp; 12:10 PM"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Confession","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"11:30AM - 12:00PM"},{"day":"Saturday","time":"4:00PM - 5:00PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"Before Masses"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Stations of the Cross","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Friday","time":"Following 12:10PM Mass during Lent"}],"descriptive":""}],"specialEvents":[{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"Second Sunday in Lent","color":"#933","location":"YouTube","times":[{"day":"February 28, 2021","time":"8:00AM"}],"descriptive":"\n\nCelebrated at the Cathedral of St. Peter-In-Chains,\nby Rev.
