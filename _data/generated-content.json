Reflect, today, upon the glorious fact that any evil or any suffering inflicted upon you unjustly can end in the glory of God and the greater salvation of souls.\n\nNo matter what you may suffer in life, if God permits it, then it is always possible for that suffering to share in the redeeming power of the Cross.\n\nConsider any suffering you have endured and embrace it freely, knowing that if God permitted it, then He certainly has some greater purpose in mind.\n\nSurrender that suffering over with the utmost confidence and trust and allow God to do glorious things through it.\n\nLet us Pray… God of all wisdom, I know that You know all things and that all things can be used for Your glory and for the salvation of my soul. Help me to trust You, especially when I endure suffering in life.\n\nMay I never despair when treated unjustly and may my hope always be in You and in Your power to redeem all things. - Fr. Joshy George"},{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"March 7, 2021","color":"#933","youtube":"EjeiTzCoXMs","descriptive":""}],"regularEvents":[{"title":"Weekend Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Saturday","time":"5:00 PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"7:30 AM, 9:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 12:00 PM"}],"descriptive":"Join us for our signature Mass."},{"title":"Weekday Mass","color":"#933","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"7:30 AM &amp; 12:10 PM"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Confession","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Monday - Friday","time":"11:30AM - 12:00PM"},{"day":"Saturday","time":"4:00PM - 5:00PM"},{"day":"Sunday","time":"Before Masses"}],"descriptive":""},{"title":"Stations of the Cross","location":"Cathedral","times":[{"day":"Friday","time":"Following 12:10PM Mass during Lent"}],"descriptive":""}],"specialEvents":[{"title":"Sunday Mass","subtitle":"Third Sunday in Lent","color":"#933","location":"YouTube","times":[{"day":"March 7, 2021","time":"8:00AM"}],"descriptive":"\n\nCelebrated at the Cathedral of St. Peter-In-Chains,\nby Most Rev.
